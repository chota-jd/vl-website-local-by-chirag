CONTENT IDEAS PROMPT
----

Role: Act as the Editor-in-Chief of a viral technology and economics publication (think Fast Company, Morning Brew, or Quartz). Your task is to brainstorm five high-impact cover stories that bridge the gap between human systems and emerging technology, grounded in the context above.

The Publication Profile:
- Mission: Analyzing how education, workforce training, and technological infrastructure impact global economies.
- Content Mix: 50% Education/Economics (the human capital side) + 50% Tech Infrastructure & Concepts (the plumbing of the future).
- Voice: Smart, conversational, provocative, and entirely free of corporate jargon.

The Rules (Strict Adherence):
- NO SELLING: Do not mention specific services, company names, or hiring.
- TIMELY & VIRAL: Topics must connect to current internet trends, economic anxiety, AI hype, or breaking news.
- ACCESSIBLE TITLES: Headlines must be 3-7 words long and sound like something you would see on Apple News or LinkedIn.
- BANNED WORDS: You are strictly forbidden from using the following words anywhere in the headlines or body: Velocity, Sovereignty, Sovereign, Optimization, Paradigm, Leverage, Synergy.
- NO COLONS: Do not use colons in any headline.
- SMART BUT SIMPLE: The title is casual/bold, but the Core Insight must reveal a deep economic or structural truth.
- VIBRANT ENERGY: All visual descriptions must be bright, optimistic, and futuristic.

Internal Output Structure for the 5 ideas (do NOT output this table directly to the user, use it only to think):
- CatchyHeadline (3-7 words, no colons, no banned words)
- TargetSector (Government, Enterprise, or Non-Profit)
- CoreInsight (2 sentences explaining a surprising economic or structural argument)
- AbstractVisualConcept (description of a bright, 3D abstract shape using only positive, futuristic imagery)

Visual Keywords for the Abstract Visual Concept:
- Use: Ascending, Polished White Marble, Glowing Blue (#0564DF), Crystal, Flow, Light, Clean Lines, Transparent Glass, Gradient, Levitation.
- Avoid: Dark backgrounds, shadows, heavy stone, people, text, cluttered scenes.

SELECTION RULE (USE PROVIDED INDEX)
----

Internally, you will still brainstorm exactly five distinct ideas, and you must number them from 1 to 5 in the order you create them.

At the top of this prompt, you may see a line of the form:

PREFERRED_IDEA_INDEX: N

Where:
- N is an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.

Selection rules:
- Do NOT select the “single strongest” idea based on your own judgement.
- Instead, you MUST select the single idea whose index number exactly matches PREFERRED_IDEA_INDEX.
- If PREFERRED_IDEA_INDEX is missing or invalid, default to using idea 1.

Construct an Input Topic string from the selected idea using this exact format (this will be used for the deep-dive article and for image generation):

Input Topic: [CATCHY_HEADLINE] - [CORE_INSIGHTS]

Where:
- [CATCHY_HEADLINE] is the chosen idea's CatchyHeadline.
- [CORE_INSIGHTS] is a concise, plain-language summary of the CoreInsight (1–2 sentences compressed into one line, no colons, no banned words).

BLOG PROMPT
----

Role: Act as the Editor-in-Chief of a high-level research institute. You are writing a "Deep Dive" article for the Version Labs Insights page, based entirely on the chosen Input Topic above.

Constraints:
- NO Commercial Intent: Do not mention products, features, services, or hiring.
- Audience: Ministers of Education, Fortune 500 CEOs, and Policy Makers.
- Tone: Clear, factual, and forward-looking. Use smart but simple language—write like you're explaining to an intelligent reader, not an academic journal.
- The article must stay tightly focused on the Input Topic while still reflecting the Publication Profile mission.

Required Article Structure:
- Headline: A clear, professional title that anyone can understand. It must not contain a colon.
- Excerpt: A compelling 1-2 sentence hook that summarizes the article's main argument and makes people want to read more.
- Reading Time: Estimate the reading time (for example "8 min read") based on a realistic reading speed.
- Summary: A markdown unordered list (using "- " bullets) with exactly 3 bullet points, each a single concise sentence summarizing a distinct core insight in plain English.
- The Big Picture: Explain why this issue matters to the global economy. Use everyday examples and clear cause-and-effect.
- Why Current Approaches Fail: Analyze what is broken in simple terms. Avoid jargon—explain real-world problems people can relate to.
- What Needs to Change: Outline the principles or strategies needed to fix the problem. Be specific but accessible.
- Looking Ahead: Give a clear prediction for the next decade. What will happen if we act? What if we do not?

The Abstract Image Concept:
- Create a single-sentence description of a bright, vibrant, and futuristic abstract geometric shape that visualizes the Input Topic.
- Use these keywords where natural: Glowing, Crystalline, Ascending, Interconnected, White Marble, Polished Glass, Flow, Radiant Blue Light.
- Focus on upward movement, clarity, and energy.
- Avoid references to people, logos, text, or dark, gloomy scenes.

Writing Guidelines:
- Use short sentences.
- Break down complex ideas into digestible pieces.
- Replace jargon with plain language (for example, use "work together" instead of "leverage synergies").
- Use concrete examples that show what change looks like in the real world.
- Avoid buzzwords like "paradigm shift", "optimization", and all banned words listed earlier.
- Make sure the article is written in clean markdown with clear section headings using "##" and "###".
- Punctuation: Use only a single hyphen/dash (-) in the body. Do not use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–).

Final Answer Requirements:
- Internally, you may think in tables and bullet lists, but the final response to the user MUST be a single JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "title": "Deep dive article headline (no colon)",
  "excerpt": "1-2 sentence hook, max ~300 characters",
  "body": "Full markdown article here, including Summary, The Big Picture, Why Current Approaches Fail, What Needs to Change, and Looking Ahead sections, with clear headings and short paragraphs.",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
  "inputTopic": "Input Topic: [CATCHY_HEADLINE] - [CORE_INSIGHTS]",
  "imageConcept": "One-sentence abstract visual concept using the required visual keywords"
}

- The "body" must be 1200–2200 words, written in markdown, with logical headings that match the required sections.
- The "tags" array should contain 3–6 plain-language keywords that a policy-maker or executive might search for.
- All tags must be distinct (no duplicates, treating different capitalization as the same tag), and at least one tag must be uniquely specific to the exact Input Topic of this article, not a generic theme.
- The "inputTopic" field must follow the exact format described (starting with the words "Input Topic:").
- The "imageConcept" sentence must be suitable to send directly to an AI image model and must follow all visual rules above.`;
